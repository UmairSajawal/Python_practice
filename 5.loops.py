# Range()
#Range functions returns a sequence of numbers, starting from 0 by default, and increments by 1 (by default), and stops before a specified number.

'''Example:
if range is 5 and  want to print all numbers i write:

seq = range(5)
print(seq[0])
print(seq[1])
print(seq[2])
print(seq[3])
print(seq[4])

Output:
0
1
2

but i want to print through for loop in range so i write:
'''
seq = range(5)
for i in seq:
    print(i)
'''Output:
0
1
2

Now i want to print directly in range so:

for num1 in range(7):   #range(stop) #1st number include and not included last number
    print(num1)
'''Output:
0
1

for num2 in range(2, 10):  #range(start, stop) #1st number include and not included last number
